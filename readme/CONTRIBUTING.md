# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

Guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create feature branches for your changes.
- Keep changes small and focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Run the site locally and verify your changes in a browser.
- For larger assets (images/videos), open an issue first to discuss storage and hosting.

Pull request checklist:

- [ ] I have tested my changes locally.
- [ ] I updated documentation where necessary.
